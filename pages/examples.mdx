## Examples

Since the language is still pretty expiremental, all of the documentation for HPL are in source files and/or examples.

The notes are there for anyone wanting to know why we do certain things like that for the sake of convenience, and it acts as a reminder for us sometimes.

[General](/examples/general/main.hpl) - General programming features of HPL and what you can do with it.

[Country](/examples/country/main.hpl) - Creating a nation.

[Event](/examples/event/main.hpl) - Creating a simple HOI4 event.
