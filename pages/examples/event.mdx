## Event

Creating a simple HOI4 event.

```c
#include <libpdx.hpl>


newMod("build/output", "Test Mod", "1.12.*")

// You have to have an "evil.png" image in the "/res" folder for this to work.
// You can of course change the path or the name of the file.
event alithronEvent = newEvent(namespace = "hpl_events", id = 56, description = "A mysterious message", "This morning at 6:32 am in the morning, we got a mysterious telegram from a high-ranking officer in Germany. They claim that Germany's planning to invade Poland in 2 weeks, however evidence to prove such a thing wasn't revealed.", imagePath = "examples/event/res/literal_evil.png")

newEventOption(alithronEvent, title = "Probably some insane person.")
newEventOption(alithronEvent, title = "Sound the alarms, time to rearm!")

print(alithronEvent)
```
