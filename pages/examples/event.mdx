## Event

Creating a simple HOI4 event.

```c
#include <libpdx.hcl>

newMod("build/output", "Test Mod", "1.12.*")

// You have to have an "evil.png" image in the "/res" folder for this to work.
// You can of course change the path or the name of the file.
event v = newEvent("hcl_events", 56, "Bad stuff", "How could this happen.", "/res/evil.png")

print(v)

newEventOption(v, "Oh no!")
```
