## Dependencies

We usually do not like including pre-compiled dependencies in projects, as then it becomes a hassle to keep things cross-platform.

So for the majority of HPL, using dependecies is stricly forbidden and should only be used as a final resort. However, using dependencies in core functions is acceptable and won't cause any fuss (though again, must be a final resort if there aren't any header-only solutions or self-implementations the function).

The dependency can only be statically-compiled or header-only and must be cross-platform between all platforms that you can play HOI4 on (Windows, Mac and Linux).

[SOIL2 (forked version)](https://github.com/EimaMei/SIL2) - for the `convertToDds` core function, HPL uses a modified version of `SOIL2` to remove unneeded OpenGL requirements.
