## Cross-platform status

HPL should work perfectly on MacOS after each commit, as that is our main host system.

Compatibility on Windows should also be usually good, however it might not be in 100% of the cases.

As for Linux, we haven't tested it out very detailed but we expect it to work perfectly. We currently do not officially support it, but will, when HPL becomes more completed.
