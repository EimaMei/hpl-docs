## Building HCL

If you're planning to build HPL, please note that the main programming environment isn't Windows, so expect possible errors and/or unusual behaviour on that platform, as from our experience it's much more buggy and annoying to program on Windows than it is on other platforms (due to mostly compiler implementations being weird and causing issues in code that works in one platform but doesn't in the other).

Here is our developer environment that'll be using for most of the HPL work:

```
OS: macOS 12.6
Compiler: Apple clang version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.102)
Architecture: x86_64
C++ standard: c++17
```

In case we use Windows:

```
OS: Windows 10
Compiler: Clang 15.0.3
Architecture: x86_64
C++ standard: c++17
```
