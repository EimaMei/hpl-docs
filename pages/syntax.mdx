## Syntax

The syntax and feature-set of HPL is almost identical to C's, features like structures, static types, declarations etc. are mostly the same.

However there are some additions as well as removals from C to make the language more approachable for HOI4 coders and tailored to HOI4 modding. The main changes are:

- There are no semicolons (`;`)
- There are HOI4-only types here (main one being `scope`)
- A variable can be declared dynamically or as a generic.

## Implemented features

A short list of things that are implemented with full functionality:

- Create and edit variables
- C-based structures (you can access and edit struct members)
- Declare functions with return types
- Execute a function and get its return
- Core functions
- Python's `f-string`
- Debug and logging modes
- Standard libraries for creating HOI4 mods (e.g. `libpdx.hpl`, `libcountry.hpl`)
- `if` statements
- Simple math (`++`, `--`, `+=`, `-=`, `=`, `/=`, `%=`)
- [HOI4 scopes](/scope)
